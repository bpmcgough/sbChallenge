 - Implement a “Date and Time picker” directive with a
 timezone support using AngularJS.
 X You may use any 3rd party libraries (Moment.js for example).
 X The directive should consist of 2 sub-directives: Date input and Time input.
 X Both inputs should be bound to the single model property.
 X Time selector should be disabled if Date is not chosen.
 X Both sub-directives should accept OPTIONAL “sb-before-render-item” function.
 X This function accepts date/time object, which has “disabled” attribute.
 Function may update that attribute (true/false) to disable/enable the date or
 time.
 X “ng-model” value should be updated only when both Date and Time chosen.
 X If both Date and Time selected, and then user updates date to a value
 which invalidates selected time, the selected time should be unset, and
 ng-model should be updated to null. For example: working hours for weekdays
 are 7AM-8PM, and for weekends - 10AM-4PM.
 X If user select Friday 8AM, and then updates Day to Sunday,
 previously selected time should become unset.
 >> sbTimeZone should be one way binded. When time zone changes, the
 selected time and date should persist to what they were before. For
 example if currently selected Date/Time is 10/26/2016 10:15AM PDT and
 time zone is changed to “America/New_York” (EST), the new selected
 date/time should be 10/26/2016 10:15AM EST.
 >> Date/Time select may be initialized with ng-model=null as well as
 already predefined date/time. If date/time predefined, it should be rendered
 within time zone according to sbTimeZone attribute, and date in calendar
 as well as time in time slots view should be selected/activated.
